You can create and download a CSV/Excel file with much less code. Do not forget to like the package if this helped you...

## Recent Changes in New Version
* Downloaded CSV file can be shared to other apps now. Just add sharing property to true in myCSV function.

## How to use it?

* Firstly, add to_csv as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
* And import this as in your dart file:
```dart
   import 'package:to_csv/to_csv.dart' as exportCSV;
```

* In your onPressed/onTap function (or wherever you like), create a list of Strings that will be the Header of your table or excel file.
```dart
 List<String> header = [];
header.add('No.');
header.add('User Name');
header.add('Mobile');
header.add('ID Number');
```
* Also create a two lists which contains your list of rows as List<String>
```dart
  List<List<String>> listOfLists = []; //Outter List which contains the data List
  List<String> data1 = ['1','Bilal Saeed','1374934','912839812']; //Inner list which contains Data i.e Row
  List<String> data2 = ['2','Ahmar','21341234','192834821']; //Inner list which contains Data i.e Row
```
**Note: Length of elements present in Rows should be equal to the length of header list length**

* Now add your data variables in listOfVisitor which is List of List of Strings actually.
```dart
  listOfLists.add(data1);
  listOfLists.add(data2);
```
* Finally pass header and listOfVisitors to the package function like this:
```dart
 exportCSV.myCSV(header, listOfLists);
```
And your csvFile will be downloaded in no minutes.
Open it on excel or in any other app and Enjoy!
